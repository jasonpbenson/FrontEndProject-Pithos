Pork skin is used for leather(football or drum heads), guts for violin strings, bones for china, oil for cutting/industrial lubricants, gelatin for marshmallows... the list is nearly endless. Tattoo artists use their skin for practice and doctors use their organs for preclinical study because they are so close to those of humans.",
