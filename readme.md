# Description
We wanted to create a space that would allow the user to experience an 'ordinary' thing in an unusual way. We were interested in ecosystems, and wanted to connect our ecosystem to the state of Georgia (home), and also the larger realms of history, mythology and health; which are their own kinds of ecosystems, or containers. <i>Pithos</i>.

# Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Google Maps API
- Open Weather Map API (WIP)

# Challenges & Solutions
Coming soon...

# MVP
A front-end-only website that is informative and aesthetically pleasing that allows the user to learn about some of the history and
mythology around plants and animals commonly farmed in Georgia. The user can also click on a map to see where various
Georgia farms are located. 
- A graphic display that corresponds to written info
- Written info stored in JS object
- Simple map with a few Georgia Farms located (using Google maps API)
- Illustrations of each farm animal/plant
- Color theme, fonts, beautiful and user-friendly layout
- Modals for information on each animal/plant when clicked
- Navigation bar with plants/animals/about
- Responsive designs for desktop, tablet, and phone
- Use of grid layout

# Stretch Goals
- Use of CSS animations for hover as well as certain click functions
- Customized map with information on Georgia farms that actively farm the plants/animals we present on our website
- Fade animations on modal/backdrop for peaceful effect
- Customized Google Maps window (both look and information)
- Background color that corresponds to weather API and/or time (still a WIP)
